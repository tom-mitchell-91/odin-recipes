    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ready in under 20 minutes, this burger with spiced chipotle chicken breast, in toasted brioche with guacamole,
        makes for a satisfying weeknight treat for one</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 chicken breast</li>
        <li>1 tsp chipotle paste</li>
        <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
        <li>1-2 slices cheese</li>
        <li>1 brioche bun, split</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the chicken breast between two pieces of cling film and bash with a rolling pin or pan to about 1cm
            thick. Mix the chipotle paste with half the lime juice and spread over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle pan over a high heat. Once hot, cook the chicken for 3 mins each side until cooked through,
            adding the cheese for the final 2 mins of cooking. Add the bun, cut-side down, to the griddle pan to toast
            lightly. Season the chicken.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mash the avocado with the remaining lime juice. Stir in the cherry tomatoes, jalape√±o and garlic,
            and season with a little salt. Spread over the base of the bun, then add the chicken followed by the top of
            the bun.</li>

    </ol>
